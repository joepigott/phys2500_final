# The potential felt by an atom in a sodium-chloride lattice is
#                     e     
# V = ---------------------------------
#     4 pi ep_0 a sqrt(i^2 + j^2 + k^2)
# where a is the space between the atoms in the lattice. Sodium atoms are present when (i + j + k) % 2 = 0 , and hold a charge of e, while chlorine atoms are present when (i + j + k) % 2 = 1, and hold a charge of -e.
